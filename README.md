Information Retrieval Project on Gender Stereotypes in Parliamentary Speeches with Word Embedding.

In word embedding models, each word is assigned to a high-dimensional vector such that the geometry of the vectors captures semantic relations between the words – e.g. vectors being closer together has been shown to correspond to more similar words. Recent works in machine learning demonstrate that word embeddings also capture common stereotypes, as these stereotypes are likely to be present, even if subtly, in the large corpora of training texts. These stereotypes are automatically learned by the embedding algorithm and could be problematic in many context if the embedding is then used for sensitive applications such as search rankings, product recommendations, or translations. An important direction of research is on developing algorithms to debias the word embeddings.

This project aims to use the word embeddings to study historical trends – specifically trends in the gender and ethnic stereotypes in the Italian parliamentary speeches from 1948 to 2020.

The dataset used is a dataset of 1 million of documents that includes all Italian parliamentary speeches from 1948 to 2020.
